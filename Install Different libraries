Open Command Prompt , and then type the following 3 commands:

python -mpip install -U pip
python -mpip install -U matplotlib
python -mpip install -U nose


This would install numpy,matplotlib and nose libraries.
In these commands, pip is the Python Installation Program.
It knows how to find packages on the web and to keep versions consistent with each other. 
The matplotlib package is one that we will use extensively in this course. Installing it automatically causes the correct supporting version of numpy to be installed.

And if you want to check what is installed, type the command
pip list

This will list the programs that pip knows about as shown below:
